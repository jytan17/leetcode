# 79. Word Search

- Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/
- Difficulty: Medium
- Category: Backtracking (NeetCode 150)

## Statement

Given an `m x n` grid of characters `board` and a string `word`, return `true` if `word` exists in the grid.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

## Examples

```
Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCCED"
Output: true

Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "SEE"
Output: true

Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCB"
Output: false
```

## Constraints

- `m == board.length`
- `n == board[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 6`
- `1 <= word.length <= 15`
- `board` and `word` consist of only lowercase and uppercase English letters.

## Target

- Time: O(m * n * 4^L) where L is word length
- Space: O(L) recursion depth
