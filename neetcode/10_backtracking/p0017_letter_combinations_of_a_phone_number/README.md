# 17. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number

- Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/letter-combinations-of-a-phone-number/
- Difficulty: Medium
- Category: Backtracking (NeetCode 150)

## Statement

Given a string containing digits from `2-9` inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent. Return the answer in any order.

A mapping of digits to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters.

- 2: abc
- 3: def
- 4: ghi
- 5: jkl
- 6: mno
- 7: pqrs
- 8: tuv
- 9: wxyz

## Examples

```
Input: digits = "23"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

Input: digits = ""
Output: []

Input: digits = "2"
Output: ["a","b","c"]
```

## Constraints

- `0 <= digits.length <= 4`
- `digits[i]` is a digit in the range `['2', '9']`.

## Target

- Time: O(4^n) where n is length of digits
- Space: O(n) recursion depth
