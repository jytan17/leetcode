# 139. Word Break

- Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break/
- Difficulty: Medium
- Category: 1-D Dynamic Programming (NeetCode 150)

## Statement

Given a string `s` and a dictionary of strings `wordDict`, return `true` if `s` can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.

## Examples

```
Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet","code"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".

Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.

Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
Output: false
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 300`
- `1 <= wordDict.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= wordDict[i].length <= 20`
- `s` and `wordDict[i]` consist of only lowercase English letters.
- All the strings of `wordDict` are unique.

## Target

- Time: O(n² × m) where m = max word length
- Space: O(n)
