# 1851. Minimum Interval to Include Each Query

- Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-interval-to-include-each-query/
- Difficulty: Hard
- Category: Intervals (NeetCode 150)

## Statement

You are given a 2D integer array `intervals`, where `intervals[i] = [lefti, righti]` describes the `i`th interval starting at `lefti` and ending at `righti` (inclusive). The size of an interval is defined as the number of integers it contains, or more formally `righti - lefti + 1`.

You are also given an integer array `queries`. The answer to the `j`th query is the size of the smallest interval `i` such that `lefti <= queries[j] <= righti`. If no such interval exists, the answer is `-1`.

Return an array `ans` where `ans[j]` is the answer to the `j`th query.

## Examples

```
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[2,4],[3,6],[4,4]], queries = [2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,3,1,4]

Input: intervals = [[2,3],[2,5],[1,8],[20,25]], queries = [2,19,5,22]
Output: [2,-1,4,6]
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= intervals.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= queries.length <= 10^5`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= lefti <= righti <= 10^7`
- `1 <= queries[j] <= 10^7`

## Target

- Time: O((n + q) log n)
- Space: O(n + q)
