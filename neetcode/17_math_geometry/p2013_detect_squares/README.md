# 2013. Detect Squares

- Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/detect-squares/
- Difficulty: Medium
- Category: Math & Geometry (NeetCode 150)

## Statement

You are given a stream of points on the X-Y plane. Design a data structure that:

- **Adds** new points from the stream into a data structure. Duplicate points are allowed and should be treated as different points.
- Given a query point, **counts** the number of ways to choose three points from the data structure such that the three points and the query point form an **axis-aligned square** with **positive area**.

An axis-aligned square is a square whose edges are all the same length and are either parallel or perpendicular to the x-axis and y-axis.

Implement the `DetectSquares` class:

- `DetectSquares()` Initializes the object with an empty data structure.
- `void add(int[] point)` Adds a new point `point = [x, y]` to the data structure.
- `int count(int[] point)` Counts the number of ways to form axis-aligned squares with point `point = [x, y]` as described above.

## Examples

```
Input:
["DetectSquares", "add", "add", "add", "count", "count", "add", "count"]
[[], [[3, 10]], [[11, 2]], [[3, 2]], [[11, 10]], [[14, 8]], [[11, 2]], [[11, 10]]]
Output:
[null, null, null, null, 1, 0, null, 2]
```

## Constraints

- `point.length == 2`
- `0 <= x, y <= 1000`
- At most `3000` calls in total will be made to `add` and `count`.

## Target

- Time: O(n) per count, O(1) per add
- Space: O(n)
